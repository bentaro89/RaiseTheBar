    "one": "It’s the snake without the rattle\nIt’s the boat without the paddle\nIt’s the duck without the waddle\nIt’s the horse without the saddle\nIt’s the ranch without the cattle\nIt’s the wars without the battle\nIt’s the tree without the apple\nWe should probably skedaddle",
    "two": "Free to eat, wow that’s sweet\nWe got a beat, let’s beat the heat\nCross the street, enjoy the treat\nDon’t have to cheat, take out a sheet\nJot this down, we’re out of town\nCan’t play around, it’s serious now\nIt will be found, through many rounds\nEnjoy the sound, the final crown"
